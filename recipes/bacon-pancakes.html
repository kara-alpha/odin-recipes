      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>These bacon pancakes are the sweet-salty combo that will

         with plenty of bacon in every bite. 
         <strong>Let's get cooking!</strong></p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>6 slices bacon</li>
         <li>1 cup pancake mix</li>
         <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
         <li>1 tbsp vegetable or avocado oil</li>
         <li>1 large egg</li>
         <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
         <li>Maple syrup, for serving</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>
            Place bacon in a large cast iron skillet
            or nonstick skillet and cook over medium-high heat,
            turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about
            10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
         </li>
         <li>
            Whisk together baking mix, milk, oil, egg, and
            cinnamon in a bowl until smooth. Crumble 2 bacon
            slices into the batter, then mix the batter again.
         </li>
         <li>
            Heat a medium-sized non-stick skillet to medium-low
            heat. Cut 1 one of the remaining bacon slices in half,
            then layu the halves in the pre-heated skillet.
            Pour just enough batter over 1 half slice to cover it.
            Repeat with the other half slice of bacon.
         </li>
         <li>
            Cook until pancakes have puffed up and bubbles have
            appeared. Flip and cook the other side until golden
            brown. Remove pancakes from the pan and repeat
            with reamining bacon and batter.
         </li>
         <li>
            Serve with maple syrup on top and any leftover bacon.
         </li>
      </ol>
